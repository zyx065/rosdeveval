  /**
  * Calculates the traversal cost to a child node for hybrid-A* planning.
  * 
  * The cost incorporates distance, collision risk, and motion preferences including
  * penalties for non-straight motions, direction changes, and reverse movements.
  * 
  * @param child The child node for which to calculate the traversal cost.
  * @return float The calculated traversal cost to reach the child node.
  * @throws std::runtime_error If the child node has an invalid (NaN) collision cost.
