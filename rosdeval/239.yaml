  * Publishes visualization markers and a boolean flag based on filter activation status and vehicle conditions.

  * @param[in] filter_activated Contains the activation status of the filter to evaluate.
  * 
  * @note The markers are only published when the vehicle meets specific conditions (autonomous mode, 
  *       sufficient velocity, and sustained filter activation). A boolean flag indicating filter 
  *       activation status is always published.
