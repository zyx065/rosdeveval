requirement: |
  /**
  * Checks whether a 2D cylinder and a 3D axis-aligned bounding box overlap in the XY-plane.
  * 
  * The cylinder is treated as infinite in the Z-direction, effectively performing collision
  * detection between the cylinder's circular base and the box's XY-projection.
  * 
  * @param center_x The x-coordinate of the cylinder's center.
  * @param center_y The y-coordinate of the cylinder's center.
  * @param radius The radius of the cylinder.
  * @param box_min_point The minimum corner point of the axis-aligned bounding box.
  * @param box_max_point The maximum corner point of the axis-aligned bounding box.
  * @return true if the cylinder and box overlap in the XY-plane, false otherwise.
