  /**
  * @brief Splits a path into segments based on directional changes for non-holonomic robots.
  * 
  * For holonomic robots, returns a single segment spanning the entire path. For non-holonomic robots,
  * segments are split at cusps (reversals) and in-place rotations.
  * 
  * @param[in] path The input path to analyze for directional changes.
  * @return A vector of PathSegment objects representing continuous directional segments.
