requirement: |
  /// @brief Marks a voxel as occupied and checks if it exceeds the marked threshold.
  /// @param x The x-coordinate of the voxel in the map grid.
  /// @param y The y-coordinate of the voxel in the map grid.
  /// @param z The z-coordinate of the voxel in the map grid.
  /// @param marked_threshold The minimum number of marks required to consider the voxel as occupied.
  /// @return True if the voxel's mark count meets or exceeds the threshold after marking, false otherwise.
  /// @note Returns false and logs a debug message if the coordinates are out of map bounds.
