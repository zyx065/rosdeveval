  /**
  * Creates the state transition matrix for a vehicle motion model.
  * 
  * This method computes the linearized state transition matrix used for predicting the next state
  * in a Kalman filter, based on the current state and time increment.
  * 
  * @param X_curr The current state vector containing [x, y, yaw, yaw_bias, vx, wz] components.
  * @param dt Time step for the state transition (in seconds).
  * @return 6x6 state transition matrix that propagates the state from time t to t+dt.
